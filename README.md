This repository hosts the code for some submissions to the [EFI NEON
Forecasting
Challenge](https://projects.ecoforecast.org/neon4cast-docs/).

These forecasts are made for mostly exploratory and educational
purposes, emphasizing simplicity and the illustration of various
forecasting concepts over technical accuracy. This repository includes a
range of forecasts of varying complexity. Each forecast focuses on
introducing a different strategy into the modeling. An earnest attempt
to produce the best forecast would draw on several of these approaches
after evaluating the relative performance of each. All forecasts here
are probabilistic: representing uncertainty is an essential component of
forecasting and a crucial element of the EFI challenge.
